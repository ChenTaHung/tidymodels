## Overview

[tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) is a "meta-package" for modeling and statistical analysis that share the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

It includes a core set of packages that are loaded on startup:

* [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as `lm`, `nls`, or `t.test`, and turns them into tidy data frames.

* [`dials`](https://dials.tidymodels.org) has tools to create and manage values of tuning parameters.

* [`dplyr`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) contains a grammar for data manipulation. 

* [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) implements a grammar of graphics. 

* [`infer`](http://infer.netlify.com/) is a modern approach to statistical inference.

* [`parsnip`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org) is a tidy, unified interface to creating models. 

* [`purrr`](http://purrr.tidyverse.org) is a functional programming toolkit.

* [`recipes`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org) is a general data preprocessor with a modern interface. It can create model matrices that incorporate feature engineering, imputation, and other help tools.

* [`rsample`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org) has infrastructure for _resampling_ data so that models can be assessed and empirically validated. 

* [`tibble`](http://tibble.tidyverse.org) has a modern re-imagining of the data frame.

* [`tune`](https://tune.tidymodels.org) contains the functions to optimize model hyper-parameters.

* [`workflows`](https://workflows.tidymodels.org) has methods to combine pre-processing steps and models into a single object. 

* [`yardstick`](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org) contains tools for evaluating models (e.g. accuracy, RMSE, etc.)

You can install the released version of tidymodels from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tidymodels")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
require("remotes")
install_github("tidymodels/tidymodels")
```

When loading the package, the versions and conflicts are listed:


```{r}
library(tidymodels)
```

This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

- For questions and discussions about tidymodels packages, modeling, and machine learning, please [post on RStudio Community](https://rstd.io/tidymodels-community).

- Most issues will likely belong on the GitHub repo of an individual package. If you think you have encountered a bug with the tidymodels metapackage itself, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/tidymodels/tidymodels/issues).

- Either way, learn how to create and share a [reprex](https://rstd.io/reprex) (a minimal, reproducible example), to clearly communicate about your code.
