`tidymodels` is a "meta-package" for modeling and statistical analysis that share the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the tidyverse.

It includes a core set of packages that are loaded on startup:

* [`broom`](https://broom.tidyverse.org/) takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as `lm`, `nls`, or `t.test`, and turns them into tidy data frames.

* [`dials`](https://tidymodels.github.io/dials/) has tools to create and manage values of tuning parameters.

* [`dplyr`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) contains a grammar for data manipulation. 

* [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) implements a grammar of graphics. 

* [`infer`](http://infer.netlify.com/) is a modern approach to statistical inference.

* [`parsnip`](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/) is a tidy, unified interface to creating models. 

* [`purrr`](http://purrr.tidyverse.org) is a functional programming toolkit.

* [`recipes`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/) is a general data preprocessor with a modern interface. It can create model matrices that incorporate feature engineering, imputation, and other help tools.

* [`rsample`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/) has infrastructure for _resampling_ data so that models can be assessed and empirically validated. 

* [`tibble`](http://tibble.tidyverse.org) has a modern re-imagining of the data frame.
 
* [`tune`](https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/) contains the functions to optimize model hyper-parameters.
 
* [`workflows`](https://tidymodels.github.io/workflows/) has methods to combine pre-processing steps and models into a single object. 

* [`yardstick`](https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/) contains tools for evaluating models (e.g. accuracy, RMSE, etc.)

There are a few modeling packages that are also installed along with `tidymodels` (but are not attached on startup): 

* [`tidypredict`](https://tidymodels.github.io/tidypredict/) translates some model prediction equations to SQL for high-performance computing.

* [`tidytext`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) contains tidy tools for quantitative text analysis, including basic text summarization, sentiment analysis, and text modeling.

```r
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/tidymodels")
```

When loading the package, the versions and conflicts are listed:
